    "# Generative AI use Case: Summarise Dialogue\n",
    "welcome to the practicle side of this course. In this lab you will do the dialogue summerisation task using generative AI. You will explore how to input text affects the output of th model, and perform prompt engineering to direct it towrds the task you need. By comparing zero shot, one shot and few shot interfeence, you will take the first step towards prompt engineering and see how it can enhance the genrative output of LLMs\n",
